acceptingcontracts | boolean
true if the host is accepting new contracts.

maxdownloadbatchsize | bytes
Maximum number of bytes that the host will allow to be requested by a single download request.

maxduration | blocks
Maximum duration in blocks that a host will allow for a file contract. The host commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current height + maxduration.

There is a block approximately every 10 minutes. e.g. 1 day = 144 blocks

maxrevisebatchsize | bytes
Maximum size in bytes of a single batch of file contract revisions. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.

netaddress | sting Remote address of the host. It can be an IPv4, IPv6, or hostname, along with the port. IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets.

remainingstorage | bytes
Unused storage capacity the host claims it has.

sectorsize | bytes
Smallest amount of data in bytes that can be uploaded or downloaded to or from the host.

totalstorage | bytes
Total amount of storage capacity the host claims it has.

unlockhash | hash Address at which the host can be paid when forming file contracts.

windowsize | blocks
A storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window that the host will accept in a file contract.

collateral | hastings / byte / block
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage that is contracted by the renter.

maxcollateral | hastings
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file contract.

contractprice | hastings
The price that a renter has to pay to create a contract with the host. The payment is intended to cover transaction fees for the file contract revision and the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.

downloadbandwidthprice | hastings / byte
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.

storageprice | hastings / byte / block
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.

uploadbandwidthprice | hastings / byte
The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.

revisionnumber | int The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with the higher revision number to be more recent.

version | string The version of the host.

firstseen | blocks
Firstseen is the last block height at which this host was announced.

historicdowntime | nanoseconds Total amount of time the host has been offline.

historicuptime | nanoseconds
Total amount of time the host has been online.

scanhistory Measurements that have been taken on the host. The most recent measurements are kept in full detail.

historicfailedinteractions | int Number of historic failed interactions with the host.

historicsuccessfulinteractions | int Number of historic successful interactions with the host.

recentfailedinteractions | int
Number of recent failed interactions with the host.

recentsuccessfulinteractions | int Number of recent successful interactions with the host.

lasthistoricupdate | blocks
The last time that the interactions within scanhistory have been compressed into the historic ones.

ipnets
List of IP subnet masks used by the host. For IPv4 the /24 and for IPv6 the /54 subnet mask is used. A host can have either one IPv4 or one IPv6 subnet or one of each. E.g. these lists are valid: [ "IPv4" ], [ "IPv6" ] or [ "IPv4", "IPv6" ]. The following lists are invalid: [ "IPv4", "IPv4" ], [ "IPv4", "IPv6", "IPv6" ]. Hosts with an invalid list are ignored.

lastipnetchange | date
The last time the list of IP subnet masks was updated. When equal subnet masks are found for different hosts, the host that occupies the subnet mask for a longer time is preferred.

publickey Public key used to identify and verify hosts.

algorithm | string Algorithm used for signing and verification. Typically "ed25519".

key | hash Key used to verify signed host messages.

publickeystring | string The string representation of the full public key, used when calling /hostdb/hosts.

filtered | boolean Indicates if the host is currently being filtered from the HostDB
